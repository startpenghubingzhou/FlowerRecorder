## What's FlowerRecorder

For a long time, the quality identification of dried flowers is a difficult and complex work, which needs to be done manually, time-consuming and laborious. FlowerRecorder is a macOS application to identify the quality of dried Hydrangea flowers.

## How it works?

This program uses [DynamicCast](https://github.com/startpenghubingzhou/DynamicCast) to identify the quality of dried flower of Hydrangea and quantify it into score. At present, white, red, pink and blue colors have been tested, and the result seems fine.

## Can I improve it?

Of course. Fow now this application is still buggy and have some more issues to fix. BTW, this app can only support Simplified Chinese for now. If you have any idea about this app,  just add PR to it.
